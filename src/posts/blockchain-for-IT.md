Blockchain is a new technology. Bitcoin is the most familiar example of a blockchain, it is the oldest most used one today.

The concept of a blockchain can be described in a simplified way as a collection of “blocks” of data, which are added to a list of such “blocks” over time and recording all the details about data manipulation for the blockchain. The blocks are linked in a special way which makes it virtually impossible to change the data in the blocks after the fact.

Blockchain technology has a reputation of being slow, expensive, complicated to manage and out in the open for all to see.

Most of these first impressions are not necessarily true. EOSIO is a tool which allows installing and managing a blockchain on a private server, fully controlled and owned by one entity, and it can replace the database and the server side code.

Why would you want to replace your database and server side code with new unfamiliar technology, you ask?

Well, there are some interesting unique benefits you can gain by adopting this technology. More on that in a later post which will probably be much longer.
